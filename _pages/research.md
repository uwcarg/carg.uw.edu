# Research

The Wilcox lab actively conducts a broad range of applied clinical data science while also developing generalizable open source tools to support foundational challenges in the secondary use of health data such as: data quality, interoperability, and computational phenotyping. Our goal is the appropriate understanding, methodology, application and translation of analytics and data science to health care. 

## Clinical Analytics

#### **Sepsis**

#### **Authentication behaviors to access clinical data**
Our goal is to assess the relationship between qualitative authentication-focused survey responses with quantitative log data, unearth different groups of users that may be best served by unique authentication schemes rather than a “one size fits all” policy, and report the effect of recent and prospective authentication implementations at UW Medicine to be generalized to other health systems. This project is an ongoing collaboration with the information security and privacy team at UW Medicine.

#### **Using the EHR to answer clinical questions**

## Data Quality

#### **Same day readmissions data quality**
The aim of this project is to assess unplanned same-day readmission prediction data quality barriers, and the hospital type variation between trauma centers, community hospitals and academic medical centers. [Thus far](/pdfs/sameDayReadmitDQ.pdf), the main barrier identified has been the difficulty of distinguishing transfers from readmissions which can be resolved by site-specific time cutoffs. We plan to continue this work by characterizing same day readmissions after data quality controls have been put in place.

#### **EHR data quality assessment tools**
The goal of this project is to create a framework and tool for data quality assessment within distributed research networks that addresses whether or not data are of quality “fit for use” for knowledge discovery from the EHR.

## **Computational Phenotyping**
